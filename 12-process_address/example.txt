The issue arises because the IntelliSense engine in VS Code is not configured to recognize `MAP_ANONYMOUS` due to missing include directories or definitions. You can fix this by updating your `c_cpp_properties.json` file to ensure that the necessary headers and defines are included.

Hereâ€™s how you can update your `c_cpp_properties.json`:

1. Add the appropriate system include paths where `sys/mman.h` resides. These paths vary depending on your Linux distribution and setup.
2. Add a define for `_GNU_SOURCE`, which ensures that GNU extensions like `MAP_ANONYMOUS` are available.

Below is an example of a properly updated `c_cpp_properties.json`:

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Linux",
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**",
                "/usr/include",
                "/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu",
                "/usr/local/include"
            ],
            "defines": [
                "_GNU_SOURCE"
            ],
            "compilerPath": "/usr/bin/gcc",
            "cStandard": "c17",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "intelliSenseMode": "linux-gcc-x64"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **`includePath`**: Adds paths where standard system headers like `sys/mman.h` can be found.
2. **`defines`**: Adding `_GNU_SOURCE` ensures that GNU-specific macros (like `MAP_ANONYMOUS`) are defined.
3. **`compilerPath`**: Specifies the path to your compiler; adjust it if you use a different compiler or location.
4. **`cStandard` and `cppStandard`**: Ensures compatibility with the C standard used in your code.

### Steps to Apply Changes:
1. Open the `.vscode` folder in your project directory.
2. Locate or create the `c_cpp_properties.json` file.
3. Replace its contents with the updated configuration above.
4. Save the file and restart the VS Code editor or reload the C/C++ IntelliSense engine by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and selecting **C/C++: Reset IntelliSense Database**.

After this update, the warning about `MAP_ANONYMOUS` should disappear.
